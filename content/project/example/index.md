{{< icon name="download" pack="fas" >}} Here is a {{< staticref "project/example/R-Code-Master-Thesis.pdf" "newtab" >}}link to the R code of my Master thesis{{< /staticref >}}.

Data Scientists spend **a lot of their time** (up to 80%) to **bring the data into the right form**. This crucial step is absolutely necessary, otherwise a data analysis cannot be performed. **The Swiss Household Panel**, which is the **dataset I used for my empirical analysis in my Master thesis**, is a good example to **illustrate my experience with data processing**. For instance, I had to:

- **re-name & select** the variables (derived from the theoretical models that I used), 
- transform the **data from wide- into long-format** (and vice versa) in order to distinguish the different family members of a household, 
- deal with **missing values**, but also 
- **create new variables** based on already existing variables. 

As these points illustrate, a considerable part of my Master thesis consisted - among other things - putting this *uncleaned* dataset into a form that was adapted for the use of the quantitative methods I had selected.
