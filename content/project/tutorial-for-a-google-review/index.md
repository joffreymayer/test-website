Nowadays, it is from utmost importance to be aware of new working frameworks and technologies all the time, otherwise competitors with better adaptability will develop much faster and - ultimately - you lose your position in the market.

In the digital age, companies must be able to establish a dialog with their customers. One possibility to increase the trust in a company and highlight very sophisticated knowledge of a brand, may be through *Google reviews*.

*By providing a rating, today's customers give future buyers the opportunity to better assess the performance of a company and thereby increase the overall transparency between the demand & supply side. Furthermore, the more a company is able to get high ratings on Google, the better the visibility on the internet will be*. 

Therefore, being able to incite customers to rate the company, is becoming extremely relevant for the future development of a brand. *That's why I created this very beginner friendly tutorial, in order to maximize the amount of Google review for a company*.
