        Responsibilities include:
        
        * <u>Web Design</u>: Programming the websites [Audiophil-Dreams.com](https://www.audiophil-dreams.com/) & [Optimize-Audio.com](https://www.optimizeaudio.com/) from scratch with the help of only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (NOT with a CMS, like WordPress).
        * <u>Establishing the digital marketing strategy</u>: Writing each of the pages’ whole content, which was around 120 pages. To get as much people on the site as possible - that is, to generate ”traffic” - I implemented *Search Engine Optimization* (SEO).
        * <u>Editing and loading-time of the site</u>: Shooting appropriate visuals for the website and using the open-source software GIMP for image editing. Furthermore, the images had to be reduced in their size to minimize a site's loading time.
