I graduated with a major in [Economics](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/oec/econ.html) and a minor in [Data Science](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/it/ds.html) from the University of Zurich.

My Master thesis, completed in October 2020, focuses on the application of random utility models and machine learning techniques, to explain people's sport behaviors. More specifically, I used already existing theories within the fields of [Behavioral Economics](https://www.oec.uzh.ch/en/studies/master/oec/econ/behavioral-economics.html), as well as Neoclassical Economics, to explain why some people develop a habit of doing sport / no sport over their life, while others decide to invert their behavior and start / stop doing sport when they become adult.
